/* jh_mem.h - v0.01 - Jason Hilder

Heavily inspired and designed from:
* https://github.com/nothings/stb/
* https://github.com/gingerBill/gb/

This is a single header file that contains:
- allocators

A implementation of the above with changes were I felt I needed them.

To use this library, do this in *one* C:
	#define JH_MEM_IMPLEMENTATION
	#include "jh_io.h"
*/

#ifndef JH_MEM_INCLUDED
#define JH_MEM_INCLUDED

#endif
